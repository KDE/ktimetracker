# Contributing to KTimeTracker

The source code for KTimeTracker can be found at https://invent.kde.org/pim/ktimetracker
and the project uses QtWidgets + KDE Frameworks.

Issues should be reported to the [KDE Bugzilla](https://bugs.kde.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=ktimetracker&component=general).

## Project Structure

The KTimeTracker source code is modular and easy to understand.

The main structure is: main loads mainwindow, which loads timetrackerwidget, which loads taskview and searchline.

The basics for understanding tasks is: taskmodelitem -> task.
A task can have a representation as an event for iCalendar management.
The projectmodel manages both tasks and events.

The rest consists of minor dialogs or actions.

---

* **desktoplist**: a single typedef for DesktopList used in model/task, dialogs/taskpropertiesdialog, desktoptracker, plannerparser, taskview, timetrackerstorage, timetrackerwidget and main
* **desktoptracker**: X11-only feature where tasks only run in certain virtual desktops
* **focusdetector**: X11-only detection for which window is currently active, used in taskview
* **idletimedetector**: uses KIdleTime to store the time spent idling, includes KGuiItem dialog
* **ktimetrackerutility**: generic collection of utilities to manage locale, time format, errors (used in ktimetrackerwidget)
* **mainwindow**: KXmlGuiWindow with a central widget TimeTrackerWidget, manages X11 window tracking, TrayIcon, and with KActionCollection shortcuts
* **reportcriteria**: collection of enums and values for exporting backup copies (work reports)
* **taskview**: main area where tasks will be listed, initialized by ktimetrackerwidget which is initialized in mainwindow which is initialized in main
* **timetrackerstorage**: base to save and load **local** iCalendar files
* **timetrackerwidget**: very large, the container for the taskview, searchline and definitions for KActionCollection actions, as well as most actions from the first screen and menu
* **tray**: simple KStatusNotifierItem and its actions
* **treeviewheadercontextmenu**: used for context menus in taskview, including when clicking the column titles

---

* **dialogs/taskpropertiesdialog**: small dialog for creating/editing new tasks
* **dialogs/edittimedialog**: small dialog that appears only with context menu
* **dialogs/historydialog**: small dialog that appears only in the Edit Time dialog
* **dialogs/exportdialog**: small dialog to export to file or clipboard

---

* **export/**: the logic for exporting backup copies in multiple formats

---

* **file/filecalendar**: the main KTimeTracker iCalendar file format
* **file/icalformatkio**: the load/save procedure for the filecalendar (**both local and remote**)

---

* **import/plannerparser**: generates an object representing a GNOME Planner XML import file

---

* **model/event**: object for date/time events
* **model/eventsmodel**: operations to manage date/time events
* **model/taskmodelitem**: base class for tasks
* **model/task**: main object for tasks
* **model/taskmodel**: operations to manage tasks
* **model/projectmodel**: high-level manager of events and tasks

---

* **settings/ktimetrackerconfigdialog**: the main Settings dialog
* **settings/cfgbehavior**: Behavior tab in the settings
* **settings/cfgdisplay**: Appearance tab in the settings
* **settings/cfgstorage**: Storage tab in the settings

---

* **tests/**: small collection of tests for various tasks like file load/save, time formatting, task creation/deletion, needs -DBUILD_TESTING

---

* **widgets/searchline**: main search bar
* **widgets/taskswidget**: Percent Complete progress bar, Percent Complete context menu, Priority context menu

## Available tasks (TODO)

* See if Planner import is still working, if it isn't, remove it
* Remove the desktop tracking feature OR make it run on Wayland
* Remove mention to karm.ics files
* Check why openFile() and saveFile() are commented out
* Find out the practical differente between timetrackerstorage and file/icalformatkio
