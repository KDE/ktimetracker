     * We create an iCalendar event to store each change. The event start
     * date is set to the current datetime. If time is added to the task, the
     * task end date is set to start time + delta. If the time is negative,
     * the end date is set to the start time.

     * In both cases (positive or negative delta), we create a custom iCalendar
     * property that stores the delta (in seconds). This property is called
     * X-KDE-ktimetracker-duration.
     *
     * Note that the ktimetracker UI allows the user to change both the session and
     * the total task time, and this routine does not account for all possible
     * cases. For example, it is possible for the user to do something crazy
     * like add 10 minutes to the session time and subtract 50 minutes from
     * the total time. Although this change violates a basic law of physics,
     * it is allowed.

     * For now, you should pass in the change to the total task time.
