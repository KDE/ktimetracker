<sect>Introduction
<p>
In my day, I may have to work on several different project and keep track 
separately of how much time I spent working on each project. If you are like me, 
then <em>Time Tracker</em> is for you.
<p>
You can enter a list of <bf>tasks</bf>, 
start the <bf>clock</bf>, and it will count the number of minutes you spend on the 
highlighted task.
<p>
Time Tracker was inspired by 
<url url="http://domen.uninett.no/~hta/" 
	name="Harald Tveit Alvestrand's">
very useful utility called 
<url url="http://domen.uninett.no/~hta/titrax/TimeTracker.html"
	name="titrax">, the 
only failing of which is that it is based on the Xt toolkit. One day Time Track
will do all that titrax does, but not today.
