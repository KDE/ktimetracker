<P>In my day, I may have to work on several different project and keep track 
separately of how much time I spent working on each project. If you are like me, 
then <EM>Time Tracker</EM> is for you.</P>
<P>You can enter a list of <B>tasks</B>, 
start the <B>clock</B>, and it will count the number of minutes you spend on the 
highlighted task.</P>
<P>Time Tracker was inspired by 
<A HREF="http://domen.uninett.no/~hta/">Harald Tveit Alvestrand's</A>
very useful utility called 
<A HREF="http://domen.uninett.no/~hta/titrax/TimeTracker.html">titrax</A>, the 
only failing of which is that it is based on the Xt toolkit. One day Time Track
will do all that titrax does, but not today.</P>
