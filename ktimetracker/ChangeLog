--------
- add confirm messagebox on "reset all times" action
- improve messagebox text for "copy totals to clipboard" action
- add preference setting to allow user to turn off logging
- add CSV export
- don't crash if timer running when you change storage file
- if storage read-only, disable actions that change data

- save tree state (open/closed) between sessions)
- edit task dialog: show full desktop name, not just desktop number
- sort data in time columns numerically, not alphabetically

switches.  So if user switches rapidly, time log won't fill up with lots of
useless entries.
