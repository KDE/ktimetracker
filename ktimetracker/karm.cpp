/*
This program is here to remind the user that karm is now called ktimetracker. 
We cannot be sure the user is on a graphical display when starting this, 
so print out and display a messagebox.
We cannot be sure the user is aware the system wants to start karm, 
so say "someone, probably you, has called karm...".

Compile it like this:
g++ -I/home/kde-devel/qt-unstable/include/Qt -I/home/kde-devel/qt-unstable/include -I/home/kde-devel/qt-unstable/include/QtCore -I/home/kde-devel/qt-unstable/include/QtGui -I/home/kde-devel/kde/include -lQtCore_debug -L/home/kde-devel/qt-unstable/lib -L/home/kde-devel/kde/lib -lkdeui karm.cpp -o karm
