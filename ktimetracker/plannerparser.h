/**
this class is here to import tasks from a planner project file to karm.
the import shall not be limited to karm (kPlaTo sends greetings)
it imports planner's top-level-tasks on the same level-depth as currentItem.
if there is no currentItem, planner's top-level-tasks will become top-level-tasks in karm.
it imports as well the level-depth of each task, as its name, as its percent-complete.
test cases:
 - deleting all tasks away, then import!
 - having started with an empty ics, import!
 - with currentItem being a top-level-task, import!
 - with currentItem being a subtask, import!
