KTimeTracker tracks time spent on various tasks. It is useful for tracking hours to be billed to different clients or just to find out what percentage of your day is spent playing Doom or reading Slashdot.

KTimeTracker was originaly written by Sirtaj Singh Kang and named KArm. The word "karm" means "work" in the author's native Punjabi.

KTimeTracker was inspired by Harald Tveit Alvestrand's very useful utility called titrax; we added some eyecandy and functionality like subtasks.
