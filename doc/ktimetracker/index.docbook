<title>Introduction</title>

<para>&ktimetracker; tracks time spent on various tasks.  It is useful for tracking
	billable hours and can report the hours logged by task and day.</para>

<para>This time history can be exported to a comma-delimited text file for
	import into other billing and/or project management tools.</para>

<para>&ktimetracker; detects when your keyboard and mouse are idle and can associate
	different tasks with different desktops, two tools that can help keep the
	timer running on the correct task.</para>

<para>&ktimetracker; was originally written by &Sirtaj.Singh.Kang;.
Its home page is <ulink
url="http://userbase.kde.org/KTimeTracker">http://userbase.kde.org/KTimeTracker</ulink>.</para>

<chapter id="using-ktimetracker">
<title>Using &ktimetracker;</title>

<sect1 id="starting">
<title>Starting &ktimetracker;</title>

<para>Type <command>ktimetracker</command> at a command prompt or select
<guimenuitem>Personal Time Tracker</guimenuitem> from the <menuchoice>
<guimenu>Applications</guimenu><guisubmenu>Utilities</guisubmenu> 
</menuchoice> group in the <guimenu>KDE start
menu</guimenu>. The standard &Qt; and &kde; command options are
available, and can be listed by entering
<userinput><command>ktimetracker</command> <option>--help</option></userinput>
at the command line.</para>

<para>&ktimetracker; provides an additional command option that allows you to enter
the name of the iCalendar file that is used to store your labor history.
You enter a remote iCalendar file by using http or ftp as part of the file
name; for example, http://www.mysite.com/mydata/mylabor.ics.</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="general-use">
<title>Tasks</title>

<informalexample>
<para><emphasis>Problem:</emphasis> You are a free software consultant with
many clients.  Some clients have multiple projects.  During the course of a
day, you switch back and forth between different projects.  You need to track
your time to generate monthly invoices.</para>
<para><emphasis>Solution:</emphasis> Create one top-level task for each client
and a subtask for each client project.  For projects that require more
detailed tracking, create a list of project subtasks.  Track time by
double-clicking on task you are currently working on.</para>
</informalexample>

<para>&ktimetracker; provides great flexibility in tracking your time, allowing
unlimited tasks and task depth.  Time may be logged to any task, and more than
one task can be active at any given time.</para>
<para>&ktimetracker; allows you to edit your task's history and to put a comment 
for every event that you have stopped.</para>
<para>
To create a top-level task, select
<menuchoice>
<shortcut>
<keycombo action="simul">&Ctrl;<keycap>T</keycap></keycombo>
</shortcut>
<guimenu>Task</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>New Task...</guimenuitem>
</menuchoice>. 

To create a subtask, pick the parent task and select

<menuchoice>
<shortcut>
<keycombo action="simul">&Ctrl;&Alt;<keycap>N</keycap></keycombo>
</shortcut>
<guimenu>Task</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>New Subtask...</guimenuitem>
</menuchoice>.
</para>

<para>When &ktimetracker; exits, the task list is saved to a file on your disk. 
When it next opens, it reloads the task list from the same file.</para>

<para>&ktimetracker; can import and export tasks to minimize your work. 
See <link linkend="interfaces">Other Systems</link>.</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="timers"><title>Timers</title>

<informalexample>
<para><emphasis>Problem:</emphasis> To remain solvent, you must bill an
average of five hours a day.  To stay on track, you watch your daily and
weekly totals.</para>
<para><emphasis>Solution:</emphasis> Reset the session timer at the
beginning of each work day and reset all timers at the beginning of each
week.</para> </informalexample>

<para>&ktimetracker; makes tracking time simple.  To start logging time against a
task, double-click on the task.  To stop logging time, double-click
the task again.  Active tasks display a small clock in the <guilabel>Session
Time</guilabel> column.</para>
	
<para>Another visual clue of logging activity is the &ktimetracker; system tray icon.
When a task is active, the second hand in the icon moves.  If you rest the
mouse pointer over this icon, the name of the active task will display in a
tooltip.  If more than one task is active, the task names in the tooltip are 
separated by commas.</para>

<para>&ktimetracker; maintains two timers for each task: one for the session time
and one for the total time.  In the default configuration, &ktimetracker; displays
two columns for each timer, resulting in a total of four columns for each task:</para>

<variablelist>
<varlistentry> <term><guilabel>Session Time</guilabel></term>
<listitem><para>The time spent on the task since the session
began.</para></listitem> </varlistentry> 

<varlistentry> <term><guilabel>Time</guilabel></term> <listitem><para>The time
spent on the task since all times were reset.</para></listitem>
</varlistentry> 

<varlistentry> <term><guilabel>Total Session Time</guilabel></term>
<listitem><para>The time spent on the task and all its subtasks since the
session began.</para></listitem> </varlistentry> 

<varlistentry> <term><guilabel>Total Time</guilabel></term>
<listitem><para>The time spent on the task and all its subtasks since all
times were reset.</para></listitem> </varlistentry> 
</variablelist>

<para>To start a new session, select
<menuchoice>
<guimenu>File</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>Start New Session</guimenuitem>
</menuchoice>
</para>

<para>To reset all times, select
<menuchoice>
<guimenu>File</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>Reset All Times</guimenuitem>
</menuchoice>
</para>

<sect2><title>Desktop Tracking</title>

<informalexample>
<para><emphasis>Problem:</emphasis> You have two main projects that you
switch between each day.  To help organize your work, you keep your project
1 files on Desktop 1 and your project 2 files on Desktop
2.</para>

<para><emphasis>Solution:</emphasis> Associate project 1 task with Desktop 1
and the project 2 task with Desktop 2.  When you switch from Desktop 2 to
Desktop 1 active, &ktimetracker; automatically stops the project 2 task and starts
the project 1 task.</para>
</informalexample>

<para>To associate a task with a one or more desktops, select
<menuchoice>
<shortcut>
<keycombo action="simul">&Ctrl;<keycap>E</keycap></keycombo>
</shortcut>
<guimenu>Task</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>Edit...</guimenuitem>
</menuchoice>.

Turn on <guilabel>Auto Tracking</guilabel> and select the desktop or desktops
to associate with this task.  When any of the selected desktops becomes active,
after a short delay &ktimetracker; will be automatically start logging time against
that task.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2><title>Idle Detection</title>

<informalexample> <para><emphasis>Problem:</emphasis> You leave work early on
Friday to run an errand and forget to stop the timer.  When you return on
Monday, the timer is still running.</para>
<para><emphasis>Solution:</emphasis> Turn on idle detection.</para>
</informalexample>

<para>&ktimetracker; can be configured to detect when the mouse and keyboard become
 idle.  If the mouse and keyboard are idle for longer than the specified
 number of minutes, &ktimetracker; displays the following dialog:</para>

<screenshot>
 <screeninfo>&ktimetracker; Idle Detection</screeninfo>
        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="idle-detect.png" format="PNG"/>

</variablelist>

</sect2>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="interfaces">
<title>Other Systems</title>
<sect2 id="korganizer"><title>&korganizer;</title>

<para>&ktimetracker;, like &korganizer; and Apple's iCal, uses the industry standard
<ulink url="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2445.html">iCalendar</ulink>
format for its data.  &ktimetracker; can read and write the to do lists created by
these two applications.</para>
<para>
You can even work synchronously on one file with &korganizer; and &ktimetracker;. 
If one program changes the file, the updates will be propagated to the other 
application automatically.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="planner"><title>Planner</title>

<para>As a typical usecase, you might want to plan a project with the project 
management tool Imendio Planner 
(from <ulink url="http://live.gnome.org/Planner">live.gnome.org/Planner</ulink>) 
and import its tasks to &ktimetracker; with <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu>
<guisubmenu>Import</guisubmenu><guimenuitem>Import Tasks From Planner...</guimenuitem>
</menuchoice>, to have them in the industry standard <ulink
url="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2445.html">iCalendar</ulink> 
format. Having done so, you are able to schedule the tasks in &korganizer;, and account your time 
to them in &ktimetracker;. That's one way to help ensure your project stays on time
and under budget.</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="dcop"><title>&DBus;</title>

<para>&DBus; is the mechanism &kde; programs use to communicate with each
other.  A &kde; program provides a list of functions that other programs (a Bash
script, for example) can use.</para>

<example><title>Bash script that echo's &ktimetracker;'s version</title>
<programlisting>
qdbus org.kde.ktimetracker /KTimeTracker version 2>/dev/null || echo "ktimetracker not running"
</programlisting>
</example>

<para>&ktimetracker;'s current &DBus; interface is currently used mainly for automated
	testing, so it is very limited.  For the full interface definition, see
	<link linkend="dcopappendix">&DBus; Interface Appendix</link>.</para>

<para>To see the full &DBus; interface of the &ktimetracker; version installed on your
	system, run the following Bash script:</para>

<example><title>List &ktimetracker;'s &DBus; interface to console</title>

</programlisting>
</example>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="csv-export"><title>Export Totals to CSV</title>

<para>&ktimetracker; can export both totals and history to a comma-delimited file
format.  To export totals, select
<menuchoice>
<guimenu>File</guimenu>
<guisubmenu>Export</guisubmenu>
<guimenuitem>Export Times...</guimenuitem>
</menuchoice> and &ktimetracker; displays the following export dialog:</para>
